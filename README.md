# NY-Yellow-cab-price-prediction

Through this model I have estimated the price of the NY Yellow cab using the real time data present on their site. Linear regression has been used to predict the fare.
EDA has been done and found out that amount, surgcharge and other such fields contain negative values, they have been adjusted and made 0. Passenger count has also been adjusted. 
Fare i.e. the output variable has been normalised and outlier and missing values have been treated and R^2 value of 82% has been achieved.

Data has been taken from the US Government official site.
